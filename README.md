# Music Releases
The assignment this week was to create a music platform site importing data from spotify using an API. 

### The Problem
This week was a bit overwhelming at first for me. I was a bit confused with all the files already existing in the project and how to grasp everything. I started with making a folder including all the components that I wanted. Then I created the first component and made sure it was working. Then followed along with the rest of the components. Once that was settled I moved on to styling in CSS and applied the hover effect etc. I used google, stack overflow and chatgbpt to help me when I approached problems. If I had more time I would continue with the stretch goals and add a header/title to the site.
