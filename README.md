# Music Releases
The assignment this week was to create a music platform site importing data from spotify using an API. 

### The Problem
This week was a bit overwhelming at first for me. I was a bit confused with all the files already existing in the project and how to grasp everything. I started with making a folder including all the components that I wanted. Then I created the first component and made sure it was working. Then followed along with the rest of the components. Once that was settled I moved on to styling in CSS and applying the hover effect etc. I used google, stack overflow and chatgbpt to help when I approached problems. If I had more time I would continue with the stretch goals and add a header/title to the site. 

### View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
